# Risk-averse Batch Active Inverse Reward Design
 An improved version of [Inverse Reward Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827) and [Active Inverse Reward Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03060) that computes the probability distribution over the true reward function in batches of test data and computes a risk-averse policy based on it.
 I used and modified part of [AIRD code](https://github.com/SoerenMind/Inverse_Reward_Design).
